This project is the replication project of the 'Volatility estimation for Bitcoin: A comparison of GARCH Models'research paper. In this report, the comparison of data and statistics results are executed.

According to the model paper, data for this project can be obtained from the 'http://www.coindesk.com/price'. However, due to unknown reason, data which is provided by the website is not completed. Thus, the author of this replication paper has to download the data from 'coindeskr'package instead. Additionally, after the verification, it is clear that the data from both sides(coindesk website and coindesk package) are not exactly the same.Hence, the diffenrence in the result may be explained by this reason.

The below code is the code for calculating the returns which is caluculated by finding the ratio of two consecutive prices and take the natural logarithm of it. After that the Mean, Median, Maximum, Minimum, Standard Deviation, Skewness, and Kurtosis of the reuturns are calculated as well.

```{r}
library(coindeskr)
data <- get_historic_price(currency = "USD", start = "2010-07-18", end = "2016-10-01")

#a vector containing log of ratios of consecutive prices
lpd<-array(dim=(nrow(data)-1))
#create array that row = row of data -1 due to ratio of consec. no.
for(j in 1:(nrow(data)-1)){lpd[j]<-log(data[j+1,1])-log(data[j,1])}
#for j in each row, lpd[j]is log of ratio of consec.data

#vector of returns
ret<-lpd

mean(ret)
median(ret)
max(ret)
min(ret)
sd(ret)
skewness(ret)
kurtosis(ret)

```

The above results can be compared to the original paper results as followed:

Original Mean = 0.005778
Original Median = 0.000290
Original Maximum = 0.528947
Original Minimum = -0.388309
Original Std. Dev. = 0.061737
Original skewness = 0.857187
Original kurtosis = 15.11666


The plot of prices

```{r}

price.ts <- as.xts(data)
plot(price.ts)

```

The plot of price returns

```{r}
returns.ts<-as.zoo(data)[-1,]
for(j in 1:(nrow(ret))){returns.ts[j]<-ret[j]}
#for j in row of ret, given 1 = no. 1 repeatedly
returns.ts<-as.xts(returns.ts)
plot(returns.ts)
```
